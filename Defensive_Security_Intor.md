Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security(blue team) include:
- User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.
- Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.
- Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
- Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.

There is much more to defensive security. Aside from the above, we will also cover the following related topics:

- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Malware Analysis

# Areas of Defensive Security
## Security Operations Center (SOC)
A team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events

- Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is unavailable, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it.
- Policy violations: A security policy is a set of rules required to protect the network and systems.
- Unauthorized activity: A SOC must detect and block security event as soon as possible before further damage is done.
- Network intrusions: An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.

## Threat Intelligence
- intelligence  refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies.
- threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.
-> Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries and to achieve a threat-informed defence.

 Data has to be collected, processed, and analyzed. Data is collected from local sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums. Learning about your adversaries lets you know their tactics, techniques, and procedures. As a result of threat intelligence, we identify the threat actor (adversary) and predict their activity. Consequently, we can mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy.

 ## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
 ### Digital Forensics
 Forensics is the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts.

- File System: Analyzing a digital forensics image (low-level copy) of a systemâ€™s storage reveals much information, such as installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, and deleted files.
- System memory: If the attacker runs their malicious program in memory without saving it to the disk, taking a forensic image (low-level copy) of the system memory is the best way to analyze its contents and learn about the attack.
- System logs: Each client and server computer maintains different log files about what is happening. Log files provide plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain.
- Network logs: Logs of the network packets that have traversed a network would help answer more questions about whether an attack is occurring and what it entails.
